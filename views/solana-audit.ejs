                <h5>Advantages of Auditing a Solana Smart Chain Project with QuillAudits</h5>
                <p>Solana has grown rapidly due to its low transaction fees. High-valued DApps are being built on Solana. Web3 projects on Solana need to think about the security aspect of it. Securing projects based on the Solana blockchain requires new and advanced skills compared to established blockchains like Solana. Smart contracts on Solana are built on Rust, which differs from Solana as it decouples code and data. Therefore, it is important to get your smart contracts on Solana audited by experts to minimise the risks associated with your project.</p>
