                <h5>Importance of Auditing a Polygon Smart Contract</h5>
                <!-- <p>The notion behind BSC was to bring DeFi into the blockchain ecosystem of Binance. It gained huge popularity in a few years, but it also grabbed the attention of attackers, thus being one of the most targeted platforms for smart contract vulnerabilities. -->
                    <!-- Most Web3 projects choose Binance due to its audience and accessibility. But the chain fails to provide a security guarantee to the projects. Therefore, project owners need to get the code of their Web3 project audited by a trustworthy firm.</p> -->

            <p>When testing a project, we focus primarily on its smart contract audit and business logic validation. Since QuillAudits has been in the auditing business for years, the majority of the vulnerabilities and bugs are known to us, and very rarely, we come across bugs that are new to us.</p>
