               <h6>Performance</h6>
               <p>Auditing the L1 chain can help identify areas where the protocol can be optimized for better performance, such as reducing block times or improving transaction speeds. This can help improve the scalability and throughput of the chain, making it more suitable for mass adoption.</p>
