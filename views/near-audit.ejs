        <h5>How do NEAR Smart Contracts Audit work?</h5>
        <p>NEAR is a relatively new yet widely adopted protocol for building Web3 and decentralized applications. Its unique combination of sharing technology and Nightshade PoS consensus mechanism offers a more efficient, scalable dApps ecosystem with low fees, paving the way for widespread Web3.0 adoption. With Web3.0 being slated as the future of the internet, it is necessary for the dApps built on this ecosystem to ensure on par or better security than existing online applications. Enabling it is QuillAuditsâ€™ three-part NEAR smart contract audit process.</p>
