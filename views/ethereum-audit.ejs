                <h5>Importance of Auditing an Ethereum Smart Contract</h5>
                <p>Smart contracts become crucial if you are developing on the Ethereum blockchain. When you are dealing with such a critical component having users' and investors' funds locked in it, safety becomes the top priority. With a thorough analysis and scrutiny of the code, you can detect those vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them. At QuillAudits, we help Web3 projects built on the Ethereum blockchain achieve credibility and gain users' and investors' trust by mitigating contract risks.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-10">
            <p>The smart contract code is examined to find the areas that fall short of quality standards, increasing the risk portion of the contract exploitation. Our veteran smart contract auditors conduct a hands-on review to analyse the bug exposure in the contracts, thereby offering remediation to fix the issue and prepare for the safe launch of the contract.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-10">
            <p>Equipped with an industry-leading suite of security tools, we run the code through automated scanners to get rid of the minute possibility of missing out on any flaws in the contract. The manual code review combined with the automated security checks terminates the scope of security vulnerabilities in the Ethereum contracts.</p>

            <p>The projectâ€™s behaviour is studied by launching it on the testnet, which helps assess its performance on the mainnet. The experts spot any shortcomings in the functioning, and mitigation guidance is offered to the project development team to rectify the errors before deployment.</p>

                <p>A Smart contract audit is a process to test the source code against all known vulnerabilities and attacks. A Smart Contract audit identifies and prevents the deployment of security vulnerabilities that may cause to loss. Both business case logic and security point of view are considered.</p>
