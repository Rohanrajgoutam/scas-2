                    <h5>Advantages of Auditing a Binance Smart Chain Project with QuillAudits</h5>
                    <p>The notion behind BSC was to bring DeFi into the blockchain ecosystem of Binance. It gained huge popularity in a few years, but it also grabbed the attention of attackers, thus being one of the most targeted platforms for smart contract vulnerabilities.
                        Most Web3 projects choose Binance due to its audience and accessibility. But the chain fails to provide a security guarantee to the projects. Therefore, project owners need to get the code of their Web3 project audited by a trustworthy firm.</p>

                <p>BSC uses a unique Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus algorithm that empowers it to create new blocks every three seconds. Our audits will ensure a smooth and accelerated development and deployment of your project on the Binance Smart Chain, preventing catastrophic vulnerabilities.
